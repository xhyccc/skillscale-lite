# Code Analysis Skill Server

This skill server handles code analysis tasks including complexity metrics,
dead code detection, and Python static analysis. Skills are loaded on demand
using the OpenSkills SKILL.md format.

## Available Skills

<available_skills>

<skill>
  <name>code-complexity</name>
  <description>
    Analyzes Python source code complexity using AST metrics and LLM-powered
    review. Computes cyclomatic complexity, nesting depth, and function length,
    then provides intelligent refactoring suggestions via LLM.

## Invocation

Skills are invoked by the skill server when it receives a task-based intent
on the `TOPIC_CODE_ANALYSIS` Kafka topic. The server uses LLM-powered
matching to select the best skill for each incoming task, loads the `<location>/SKILL.md`
for full instructions, and executes OpenCode using `<location>/scripts/run.py`.
